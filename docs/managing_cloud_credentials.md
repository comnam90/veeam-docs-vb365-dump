# Managing Cloud Credentials


Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 allows you to configure cloud credentials that you can use to access the following types of object storage:

* [S3 Compatible, IBM Cloud Object Storage and Wasabi Cloud Object Storage](s3_compatible_access_key.md)
* [Amazon S3](aws_access_key.md)
* [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](azure_storage_account.md)

If you want to use the Azure archiver appliance when Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 transfers backed-up data between different instances of Azure Blob Storage or to Azure Blob Storage Archive, you must add the [Microsoft Azure service account](azure_service_account.md).
