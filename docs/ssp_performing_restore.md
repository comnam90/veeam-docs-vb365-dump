# Performing Restore


After logging in to Restore Portal, you can explore and restore data from backups created by Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365. If you act as an end user, you perform self-service restore of your own data. If you have a restore operator permissions, you explore and restore backed-up data for those objects that you are allowed to manage. For more information about Restore Portal usage scenarios, see [Restore Portal Usage Scenarios](ssp_operation_scenarios.md). For more information on how to assign permissions to a restore operator, see [Adding Restore Operator Role](ssp_adding_operator_roles.md).
