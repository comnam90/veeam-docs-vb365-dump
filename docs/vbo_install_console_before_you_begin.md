Before you install the Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 console, check the following prerequisites:

* The Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 console must be of the same version as Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 installed on the Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 server.
* A machine on which you plan to install the Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 console must meet the system requirements. For more information, see [System Requirements](vbo_system_requirements.md#ManagementServer).
* A user account used for the Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 console installation must be a member of the local Administrators group or have been assigned the Veeam Backup Administrator role. For more information, see [Managing Users and Roles](manage_users_roles.md).
* Backup infrastructure components communicate with each other over specific ports. These ports must be open. For more information, see [Ports](vbo_used_ports.md).
