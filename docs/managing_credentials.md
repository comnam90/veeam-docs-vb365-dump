# Credentials


In Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365, you can use the following types of credentials:

* [Cloud credentials](managing_cloud_credentials.md)

You can use this type of credentials to work with [object storage repositories](vbo_osr.md).

* [Encryption passwords](managing_passwords.md)

You can use this type of credentials to encrypt data in object storage.

Both cloud credentials and encryption passwords are stored in Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 and encrypted using the Data Protection API (DPAPI) mechanisms. For more information, see [this Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms995355%28v%3Dmsdn.10%29).
