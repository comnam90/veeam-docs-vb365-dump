Restore Portal is a web-based solution that allows users to perform self-service restore of backed-up data. They can explore and restore Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams data from backups created by Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365.

Restore Portal offers two scenarios for data restore: self-service restore and operator restore. For more information about available usage scenarios, see [Restore Portal Usage Scenarios](ssp_operation_scenarios.md).

Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 users who take part in the Restore Portal usage scenarios can be divided into three groups:

* Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 administrators — IT specialists who use Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 to protect data in Microsoft organizations. They maintain the Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 backup infrastructure, configure general application settings including the [REST API](vbo_rest_api_settings.md), [Authentication Settings](vbo_authentication_settings.md) and [Restore Portal](vbo_restore_portal_settings.md) settings, and [assign permissions](ssp_adding_operator_roles.md) to users who act as restore operators.
* Restore operators — a service provider representatives or other users who restore data from backups created by Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 for other users.
* End users — users of a Microsoft 365 organization who perform self-service restore of their own backed-up data.

If the Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 administrator in a Microsoft 365 organization has configured the REST API and Restore Portal settings in Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365, restore operators and end users access Restore Portal from any computer and perform all operations in a web browser window. For more information, see [Launching Restore Portal](ssp_launch.md) and [Performing Restore](ssp_performing_restore.md).
