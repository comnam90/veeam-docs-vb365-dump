Before you add a restore operator role, check the following prerequisites:

* You can add restore operator roles for users and groups of Microsoft 365 organizations and hybrid organizations. Keep in mind that for hybrid organizations, only Microsoft 365 objects can be processed.
* The organization for which you want to add a restore operator role must be added to Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 using the modern app-only authentication method.
