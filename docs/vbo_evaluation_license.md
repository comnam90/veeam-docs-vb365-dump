# Evaluation License


Evaluation License is a free and fully-functional license that can be used for evaluation and testing purposes only.

License Expired

Within a month before the expiration date, you will receive a notification message stating that your license is about to expire. During this period, the product functionality will not be limited by any means. After your license expires, Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 stops processing of all user accounts.

The restore abilities will continue to function regardless of whether your license has expired or not.

License Exceeded

Processing of user accounts that exceed the allowed license count is not possible.
